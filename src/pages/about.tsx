        way to take quizzes. They envisioned a system that could understand the
        nuances of language and respond to questions in a way that was more
        natural and conversational. With this idea in mind, they set out to
        create Quizzify-AI, a revolutionary new platform that would change the
        way people take quizzes forever.
